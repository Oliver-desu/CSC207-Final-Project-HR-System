+++ July 8th +++

Unfinished:
    Login Class
    ApplicantIncompleteBoxPanel(One particular view of #3(4))
    MainPanel(settings and interface functions)
    One Irregular look of Main Page(HR post job #3), not decided the relationship with MainPanel yet, may not call it MainPanel

    Connection between ViewFrame and four main components:
    MenuPanel(A view list, not decided whether to be a class), Login, Search, Main

    The size and showing part is not composed yet.
    But other classes, if you want to check one by one, is able to visualize.

For Controller use:
    desired "The View" is ViewFrame.
    You can add listener with specified its button name and get some basic information form ViewFrame.

    Since the class cannot be to big.
    You can call ViewFrame.getMain to use other support methods in Main.
    Those methods in main is not quite typical so I have comments their.
